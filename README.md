This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# The project

This is a react application that gives the user a "random" quote, currently using a js file to store ~100 unique quotes.
You are also given the opportunity to share this quote on Twitter.

## What I learned 

*How to create a button to share something on Twitter, with initial text included
*Passing props to react elements
*Conditional rendering (if author is unknown)
*How to use yarn & netlify to create a production build and host it

## See it in action

## Future implementations

*Make an API call to receive a "random" quote from a larger database, while getting rid of the local quote database
