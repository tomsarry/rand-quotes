# The project

This is a react application that gives the user a random quote, using an API to get it.
You are also given the opportunity to share this quote on Twitter.

## What I learned 

* How to create a button to share something on Twitter, with initial text included
* Make API calls and modify content appropriately using React.
* Passing props to react elements
* Conditional rendering (if author is unknown)
* How to use yarn & netlify to create a production build and host it
